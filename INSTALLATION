    * AAC Encoding Library (tested with faac-1.28-6.fc9.rpm) 

Installation Steps

   1. Install a Java 6 SDK (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)
   2. Install the Apache Tomcat 6 Servlet Container (http://tomcat.apache.org/)
   3. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location where you installed the Java SDK
         1. Example: export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk6 
   4. Set the CATALINA_HOME environment variable to the location where you install Tomcat
         1. Example: export CATALINA_HOME=/home/foo/bin/tomcat/ 
   5. Set the JAVA_OPTS environment variable to specify the location of the MythPodcaster properties file
         1. Example: export JAVA_OPTS="-Dmythpodcaster.prop.dir=/home/foo/config/" 
   6. Start the Tomcat server
         1. Example: ${CATALINA_HOME}/bin/startup.sh 
   7. Verify that you can access the Tomcat server using a web browser
         1. Example: http://localhost:8080/ 
   8. Copy the mythpodcaster.properties file to the location configured earlier:
         1. cp mythpodcaster.properties /home/foo/config/
   8. Copy the transcoding_profiles.xml file to the location configured earlier:
         1. cp transcoding_profiles.xml /home/foo/config/
   9. Edit the mythpodcaster.properties file to meet your requirements.
         1. vi /home/foo/config/mythpodcaster.properties 
  10. Copy the MythPodcaster WAR file to the Tomcat webapps directory
         1. cp MythPodcaster.war ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ 
  11. Monitor the MythPodcaster log file to verify that it deploys successfully
         1. tail -f /tmp/mythpodcaster.log 
  12. Access the MythPodcaster web application to create your subscriptions.
         1. Example: http://localhost:8080/MythPodcaster/


Usage

Once the application is installed, access the web application to manage your 
subscriptions. You can subscribe to any program that has at least one MythTV 
recording available. Upon subscribing to a series, you'll notice that there 
are not any entries immediately available in the Feed. This is because it takes 
time for the recording to be transcoded into an encoding appropriate for  
podcasts. MythTV recordings range in size from 4GB/hour to 9 GB/hour 
depending on the quality of the source. The transcoding process will create 
a copy of the original recording in a much smaller resolution and higher 
compression. You may adjust the encoding parameters in the 
mythpodcaster.properties file to meet your requirements.

The Transcoder will run at 5 minutes intervals by default. When it runs, it 
looks for new episodes of programs series that are subscribed to. If new 
episodes are found, then they will be transcoded and added to the feed. If 
episodes in the feed are no longer in the MythTV database because they've been 
deleted or expired, then the transcoded files will be deleted and the feed 
entries removed. If a clip is unable to be transcoded, then an entry will be 
added to the feed, but the entry will not contain a link to content. I've not 
had any difficulty transcoding MythTV recordings; transcoding failure is 
typically due to incorrect FFMPEG encoding options.

Once transcoding has completed, the entries will be added to the feed file 
(RSS file). You can access the RSS file using your web-browser of choice 
(Firefox, Safari, IE, etc) and with feed aggregators like iTunes. iTunes is 
capable of downloading the media files referenced in the feed. You can then 
view the media files within iTunes or transfer them to a media player, such 
as the iPod Touch or iPhone.

The MythPodcaster application writes log files to the /tmp/mythpodcaster.log 
by default. It is recommended that you refer to this log file for 
troubleshooting the application.
