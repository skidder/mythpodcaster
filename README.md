Transcoder & RSS Publisher for MythTV Recordings

The MythTV Digital Video Recorder (DVR) is a great platform for recording and watching video content at home. But wouldn't it be great to access your recordings from your mobile device or computer when you're away?

The MythPodcaster application allows you to transcode (convert) your MythTV recordings into any number of audio and video formats automatically. The recordings are published in standard RSS feeds that can be imported into most media players, such as iTunes. Recordings are also published in customizable HTML5 web pages that you can access with any browser.
